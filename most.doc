[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mmost[24m is a paging program that displays, one windowful at  a  time,  the
       contents  of  a file on a terminal.  It pauses after each windowful and
       prints on the window status line the screen the file name, current line
       number, and the percentage of the file so far displayed.

       Unlike  other  paging  programs, [4mmost[24m is capable of displaying an arbi-
       trary number of windows as long as each window occupies  at  least  two
       screen  lines.   Each  window  may contain the same file or a different
       file.  In addition, each window has its own  mode.   For  example,  one
       window  may  display a file with its lines wrapped while another may be
       truncating the lines.  Windows may be `locked' together  in  the  sense
       that  if  one  of  the  locked windows scrolls, all locked windows will
       scroll.  [4mmost[24m is also capable  of  ignoring  lines  that  are  indented
       beyond  a  user  specified value.  This is useful when viewing computer
       programs to pick out gross features of the code.  See the `[1m:o[22m'  command
       for a description of this feature.

       In  addition  to  displaying ordinary text files, [4mmost[24m can also display
       binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.  When  a
       file  is  read  into  a buffer, [4mmost[24m examines the first 32 bytes of the
       file to determine if the file is a binary file and then switches to the
       appropriate  mode.   However,  this feature may be disabled with the [1m-k[0m
       option.  See the description of the [1m-b[22m, [1m-k[22m, [1m-v[22m, and [1m-t [22moptions for fur-
       ther details.

       Text files may contain combinations of underscore and backspace charac-
       ters causing a printer to underline or overstrike.   When  [4mmost[24m  recog-
       nizes  this, it inserts the appropriate escape sequences to achieve the
       desired effect.  In addition, some files cause  the  printer  to  over-
       strike  some  characters by embedding carriage return characters in the
       middle of a line.  When this occurs, [4mmost[24m displays the overstruck char-
       acter  with  a bold attribute.  This feature facilitates the reading of
       UNIX man pages or a document produced by [4mrunoff[24m.  In particular,  view-
       ing  this  document  with [4mmost[24m should illustrate this behavior provided
       that the underline characters have not  been  stripped.   This  may  be
       turned off with the [1m-v [22moption.

       By  default, lines with more characters than the terminal width are not
       wrapped but are instead truncated.  When  truncation  occurs,  this  is
       indicated by a `$' in the far right column of the terminal screen.  The
       RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys may be used to view lines which  extend  past
       the  margins of the screen.  The [1m-w [22moption may be used to override this
       feature.  When a window is wrapped, the character `\'  will  appear  at
       the right edge of the window.

       Commands are listed below.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-1     [22mVT100  mode.   This  is  meaningful  only  on VMS systems.  This
              option should be used if the terminal is strictly a VT100.  This
              implies  that  the  terminal does not have the ability to delete
              and insert multiple lines.  VT102s and above have this  ability.

       [1m-b     [22mBinary  mode.   Use this switch when you want to view files con-
              taining 8 bit characters.  [4mmost[24m will display the file  16  bytes
              per line in hexadecimal notation.  A typical line looks like:

                   01000000 40001575 9C23A020 4000168D     ....@..u.#. @...

              When used with the [1m-v [22moption, the same line looks like:

                   ^A^@^@^@  @^@^U u 9C #A0    @^@^V8D     ....@..u.#. @...

       [1m-C     [22mDisable color support.

       [1m-M     [22mDisable the use of mmap.

       [1m-s     [22mSqueeze.  Replace multiple blank lines with a single blank line.

       [1m-z     [22moption turns off gunzip-on-the-fly.

       [1m-v     [22mDisplay control characters as in `^A' for control  A.   Normally
              [4mmost[24m does not interpret control characters.

       [1m-t     [22mDisplay  tabs as `^I'.  This option is meaningful only when used
              with the [1m-v [22moption.

       [1m+[4m[22mlineno[0m
              Start up at [4mlineno[24m.

       [1m-c     [22mMake searches case sensitive.  By default, they are not.

       [1m-u     [22mDisable UTF-8 mode even if the locale dictates it.

       [1m+u     [22mForce UTF-8 mode.  By default most will use the  current  locale
              to  determine  if  UTF-8  mode  shoul  be  used.   The [1m+u [22mand [1m-u[0m
              switches allow the behavior to be overridden.

       [1m+d     [22mThis switch should only be used if you want the option to delete
              a file while viewing it.  This makes it easier to clean unwanted
              files out of a directory.  The file is deleted with the interac-
              tive key sequence `[1m:D[22m' and then confirming with `[1my[22m'.

       [1mf[22m, [1m/[22m, [1mCTRL-F[22m, [1mFIND[22m, [1mGOLD PF3[0m
              Prompt for a string and search forward from the current line for
              [4mi[24mth distinct line containing the string.  [1mCTRL-G [22maborts.

       [1m?      [22mPrompt  for  a  string  and search backward for the [4mi[24mth distinct

              Set a mark on the current line for later reference.

       [1mINSERT_HERE, CTRL-X CTRL-X, COMMA, CTRL-K RETURN, GOLD PERIOD[0m
              Set  a  mark  on  the  current line but return to previous mark.
              This allows the user to toggle back and forth between two  posi-
              tions in the file.

       [1ml[22m, [1mL   [22mToggle  locking  for this window.  The window is locked if there
              is a `*' at the left edge of the status  line.   Windows  locked
              together, scroll together.

       [1mCTRL-X 2[22m, [1mCTRL-W 2[22m, [1mGOLD X[0m

       [1mCTRL-X 1[22m, [1mCTRL-W 1[22m, [1mGOLD O[0m
              Delete all other windows, leaving only one window.

       [1mE[22m, [1me   [22mEdit this file.

       [1m$[22m, [1mESC $[0m
              This  is  system dependent.  On VMS, this causes [4mmost[24m to spawn a
              subprocess.  When the user exits the process, [4mmost[24m  is  resumed.
              On UNIX systems, [4mmost[24m simply suspends itself.

       [1m:n     [22mSkip  to  the  next filename given in the command line.  Use the
              arrow keys to scroll forward or backward through the file  list.
              `[1mQ[22m' quits [4mmost[24m and any other key selects the given file.

       [1m:c     [22mToggle case sensitive search.

       [1m:D     [22mDelete  current  file.  This command is only meaningful with the
              [1m+d [22mswitch.

       [1m:o[22m, [1m:O [22mToggle various options.  With this key sequence, [4mmost[24m displays a
              prompt asking the user to hit one of: [1mbdtvw[22m.  The `[1mb[22m', `[1mt[22m', `[1mv[22m',
              and `[1mw[22m' options have  the  same  meaning  as  the  command  line
              switches.   For  example, the `[1mw[22m' option will toggle wrapping on
              and off for the current window.

              The `[1md[22m' option must be used with a prefix integer [4mi[24m.  All  lines
              indented  beyond  [4mi[24m columns will not be displayed.  For example,
              consider the fragment:

                   int main(int argc, char **argv)
                   {
                        int i;

                        for (i = 0; i < argc, i++)
                        {
                             fprintf(stdout,"%i: %s\n",i,argv[i]);
                        }
                        return 0;
                   }

              The key sequence `[1m1:od[22m' will cause  [4mmost[24m  to  display  the  file
              ignoring all lines indented beyond the first column.  So for the
              example above, [4mmost[24m would display:

                   int main(int argc, char **argv)...
                   }

              where the `...' indicates lines follow are not displayed.

[1mHINTS[0m
       [1mCTRL-G [22maborts the commands requiring the user to type something in at a
       prompt.   The  backquote key has a special meaning here.  It is used to
       quote certain characters.  This is useful when search  for  the  occur-
       rence of a string with a control character or a string at the beginning
       of a line.  In the latter case, to find the occurrence of `The' at  the
       beginning of a line, enter [1m`^JThe [22mwhere [1m` [22mquotes the [1mCTRL-J[22m.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [4mmost[24m uses the following environment variables:

       [1mMOST_SWITCHES[0m
              This  variable  sets  commonly used switches.  For example, some
              people prefer to use [4mmost[24m with the  [1m-s  [22moption  so  that  excess
              blank  lines  are  not  displayed.  On VMS this is normally done
              done in the login.com through the line:

                   $ define MOST_SWITCHES "-s"

       [1mMOST_EDITOR[22m, [1mSLANG_EDITOR[0m
              Either of these environment variables specify an editor for [4mmost[0m
              to  invoke  to edit a file. The value can contain %s and %d for-
              matting descriptors that represent the file name and  line  num-
              ber, respectively.  For example, if JED is your editor, then set
              [1mMOST_EDITOR [22mto 'jed %s -g %d'.

       [1mMOST_HELP[0m
              This variable may be used to specify an alternate help file.

       [1mMOST_INITFILE[0m
              Set this variable to specify the  initialization  file  to  load
              during  startup.   The default action is to load the system con-
              figuration file and then a personal  configuration  file  called
              [4m.mostrc[24m on Unix, and [4mmost.rc[24m on other systems.

[1mCONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX[0m
       When  most  starts up, it tries to read a system configuration file and
       then a personal configuration file.  These files may be used to specify
       keybindings and colors.

       To bind a key to a particular function use the syntax:

       [1msetkey function-name key-sequence[0m

       The  [4msetkey[24m command requires two arguments.  The [4mfunction-name[24m argument
       specifies the function that is to be executed as a response to the keys
       specified by the [4mkey-sequence[24m argument are pressed.  For example,

             setkey   "up"     "^P"

       indicates  that  when  [4mCtrl-P[24m  is pressed then the function [4mup[24m is to be
       executed.

       Sometimes, it is  necessary  to  first  unbind  a  key-sequence  before
       rebinding it in order via the [4munsetkey[24m function:

              unsetkey "^F"

       Colors  may  be defined through the use of the [4mcolor[24m keyword in the the
       configuration file using the syntax:

       [1mcolor OBJECT-NAME FOREGROUND-COLOR BACKGROUND-COLOR[0m

       Here, OBJECT-NAME can be any one of the following items:

           status           -- the status line
           underline        -- underlined text
           overstrike       -- overstriked text
           normal           -- anything else

       See the sample configuration files for more information.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Almost all of the known bugs or limitations of [4mmost[24m are due to a desire
       to  read  and  interpret control characters in files.  One problem con-
       cerns the use of backspace characters to underscore or overstrike other
       characters.   [4mmost[24m makes an attempt to use terminal escape sequences to
       simulate this behavior.  One side effect is the one does not always get
       what one expects when scrolling right and left through a file.  When in
       doubt, use the [1m-v [22mand [1m-b [22moptions of [4mmost[24m.
